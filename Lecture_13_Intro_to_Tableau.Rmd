- A lot of this class has been spent going over different kinds of graphing software - Excel, **ggplot2** in R, and Tableau
- (not to mention all we leave out - PowerBI, **matplotlib**/**Seaborn** in Python, every stats package other than R, etc. etc.)
- Today we'll be going over Tableau
- Why introduce these different tools, and what do they do?

## Graphing Software

- It's most important that we understand the underlying concepts of data communication
- But also we have to know how to implement those concepts
- And since so much of this is subjective, we have to practice, practice, practice. Working with the software is a requirement!
- Plus, stuff like learning the grammar of graphics, baked into **ggplot2**, can help strengthen those concepts

## Graphing Software

- Excel: Low-power but entry-level. **Great for tiny data sets that need standard graphical formats,** i.e. graphically demonstrating the kinds of reports and accounting spreadsheets that are commonly in Excel anyway
- **Not great for big data sets** (and the graphs it chooses to make easy favor ones that work best with small data), **not great for contrasting groups**, **not great for summarizing-and-then-graphing**
- Not reproducible
- Customization is easily accessed but laborious

## Graphing Software

- R: High-power but with a learning curve. **Great for any size data sets**, **great for summarizing**, **endless customization**. **Great for contrasting groups**
- **If the data isn't already in graphable format, R itself is crucial for cleaning/formatting it**
- Supports **dashboards**, **notebooks**, **interactivity**, and **animation**
- Until you're used to it, **a lot of work to get going though!**
- Because there is **direct access to the underlying pieces of the graph**, there is no better tool for making **one beautiful image**
- Requires additional work for working with enormous databases

## Graphing Software

- Tableau: High-power, with less learning curve, but more constrained. **Great for any size data sets**, **great for summarizing**, **great for contrating groups**
- Great at making a **host of graphs at once to explore a data set thoroughly**
- It can **smartly suggest for you what kind of graph to use**
- Built-in easy to work with tools for **enormous databases** and **dashboards**
- Everythign is **interactive by default**
- **Easier than R** and also less work but **deep customization a bit more difficult**

## Tableau

- As opposed to Excel or (the way we've used) R, Tableau uses *database* logic - it sends the calculation **to the data** rather than bringing the data to the calculation
- So we'll have "connections" to data rather than bringing data in; also, if data updates, so will Tableau
- And the output we have will include underlying data, but only our calculations of the data.
- Let's walk through some usage of Tableau


## Importing Data

- A connection can be "Live" (database-like) or an "Extract" (bring it in!)
- Specify how variables should be read by clicking on them
- Tableau will guess as much as possible
- Unlike R we do filtering, selection, and recoding at THIS step

## Importing Data

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('Lecture_13_Data_Import.png')
```

## Importing Data

- NAs can make it think it's a string, let's tell it earnings is a number
- Let's group `pred_degree_awarded_ipeds`: 1 = less-than-two-year college, 2 = two-year, 3 = four-year+
- Could also do a filter here, or only select certain variables
- Or create variables calculated from others - let's make an employment rate

## The Tableau Screen

- Dimensions (categorical) and measures (continuous numeric) on the left. Tableau really cares about discrete vs. continuous.
- Columns and Rows areas to drag to
- (single image export: Worksheet $\rightarrow$ Copy image)
- "Show me" default graphs on the right. Decent for initial exploration but generally not what you want to work with

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('Lecture_13_Tableau_Main.png')
```


## Working with Variables

- To start making a graph, think about what you want on the x-axis (column) or y-axis (row)
- How it treats a variable can then be manipulated: discrete vs. continuous and measure vs. dimension. Measures get aggregated/summarized in some specified way, dimensions don't!
- Plenty of aggregation options for continuous variables

## Working with Variables

- Also click the variables to do things like sort the order or turn them "dual axis" (two variables on the same axis)
- In general, like Excel, click what you want to edit, like axis titles
- Note with a graph we can find the data that goes into it
- Some variables like "Measure Names" can become their own "shelf" like column/row for more complex diagrams

## Basic Example

- Let's remake it!

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('Lecture_13_Tableau_Employment.png')
```

## Basic Example

- This one is trickier!

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('Lecture_13_Tableau_Repayment.png')
```

## Basic Example

- Let's do this one together: what should be in rows and columns here?

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('Lecture_13_Tableau_Map.png')
```

## Another Example

- We can also set labels by clicking-and-labeling, like Excel
- Let's replicate the graph on the next page

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics('Lecture_13_Tableau_Boxplot.png')
```

## And Explore

- Click around and make your own graph
- See what kinds of customizations you can do
