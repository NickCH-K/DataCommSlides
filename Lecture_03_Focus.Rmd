- We want to tell a story with our data
- Some stories are clear
- Others are complex
- They all need to be clear
- And we may need to walk the reader along

## The Three Rules of Presentation

- Tell them what you're going to tell them
- Tell them
- Tell them what you told them

## Presentation

- Your audience does not know what you know
- In many cases they may not care as much as you care
- And even if they know and care, they may not understand the way you think about it
- Don't be afraid to hold their hand

## Presentation

- When transmitting information, always let the reader know where to go
- Really well-done research or argumentative writing makes the reader think of the next point you're going to make before you even make it
- Similarly, well done data communication doesn't assume knowledge of the reader and is willing to direct their attention.

## Focus

- We are already trying to focus our reader by making the viz in the first place
- After all, we could avoid focusing them entirely by just showing the full data set, but we don't do that
- Can we focus them further to make the story even clearer?

## Preattentive Attributes

- Our brain knows what to look out for
- How can we direct the eye where we need it to go?
- Thankfully, (most of) you have been looking with your eyes your whole life!
- So this should be pretty intuitive

## Preattentive Attributes in Images

- Note some overlap here with our attributes for categorizing things
- But here the purpose is not to distinguish two equal things
- But rather to emphasize one important thing!
- Let's go through some commonly usable ones:

## Color

```{r}
data(gapminder, package='gapminder')

ggplot(gapminder %>%
         filter(year == 2007), 
       aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent == 'Asia')) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  labs(x = 'GDP Per Capita (log scale)',
       y = 'Life Expectancy',
       title = 'Asia\'s Low-Income Countries have High Life Expectancy') + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  guides(color = FALSE) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c('#33ccFF','red')) +
  annotate(geom='text',x=20000,y=65,color='red',label='Asia',size=8)
```

## Intensity

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder %>%
         filter(year == 2007), 
       aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent == 'Asia', alpha = continent == 'Asia')) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  labs(x = 'GDP Per Capita (log scale)',
       y = 'Life Expectancy',
       title = 'Asia\'s Low-Income Countries have High Life Expectancy') + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  guides(color = FALSE, alpha = FALSE) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c('#33ccFF','red')) +
  scale_alpha_manual(values = c(.4,1)) + 
  annotate(geom='text',x=20000,y=65,color='red',label='Asia',size=8)
```

## Size


```{r}
ggplot(gapminder %>%
         filter(year == 2007), 
       aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, 
           color = continent == 'Asia', 
           alpha = continent == 'Asia',
           size = continent == 'Asia')) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  labs(x = 'GDP Per Capita (log scale)',
       y = 'Life Expectancy',
       title = 'Asia\'s Low-Income Countries have High Life Expectancy') + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  guides(color = FALSE, alpha = FALSE, size = FALSE) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c('#33ccFF','red')) +
  scale_alpha_manual(values = c(.4,1)) + 
  scale_size_manual(values = c(1,2)) + 
  annotate(geom='text',x=20000,y=65,color='red',label='Asia',size=8)
```

## Width

```{r}
gapyrs<- gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent, year) %>%
  summarize(lifeExp = mean(lifeExp))

ggplot(gapyrs, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = continent, size = continent == 'Asia')) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_dl(aes(x = year + .5,label = continent), method = 'last.bumpup') + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1950,2015)) +
  labs(x = 'Year',
       y = 'Average Life Expectancy',
       title = 'Overall Life Expectancy in Asia is Low') + 
  scale_size_manual(values = c(.5, 1.5)) + 
  guides(size = FALSE) + 
  theme_tufte()
```

## Enclosure

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder %>%
         filter(year == 2007), 
       aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  labs(x = 'GDP Per Capita (log scale)',
       y = 'Life Expectancy',
       title = 'There is a Small Cluster of Rich and Long-Lived Countries') + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  annotate('rect', xmin = 16000, xmax = 50000, ymin = 68, ymax= 85, alpha = .2)+
  annotate('text', x = 16000, y = 62, hjust = 0,
           label = 'Even here,\nthere is a\npositive\nrelationship.')
```


## Preattentive Attributes in Text

- These are more obvious
- Bold, color, italics, size, spatial separation, enclosure, underline

## Keep in Mind

- With all of these attributes, some are more important than others!
- And more intensity generally means more attention
- Rather than providing a direct order, remember that it's subjective - try things out, see what is intuitive

## An Example

```{r}
data(SPrail, package='pmdplyr')

SPrail_dow <- SPrail %>%
  filter(!is.na(fare)) %>%
  mutate(fare = factor(fare)) %>%
  mutate(dow = factor(weekdays(start_date), levels = c('Sunday','Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday','Friday','Saturday'))) %>%
  group_by(fare, dow) %>%
  summarize(price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(SPrail_dow, aes(x = fare, y = price, fill = dow)) + 
  geom_bar(position = 'dodge', stat = 'identity') + 
  labs(fill = 'Day of Week',
       x = 'Fare Type',
       y = 'Average Price',
       title = 'Flexible-Ticket Resale Prices are Lower on Weekends') + 
  theme_minimal()

```

## Use Color Sparingly

```{r}
SPrail_dow <- SPrail %>%
  filter(!is.na(fare)) %>%
  mutate(fare = factor(fare)) %>%
  mutate(dow = factor(weekdays(start_date), levels = c('Sunday','Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday','Friday','Saturday'))) %>%
  mutate(weekend = dow %in% c('Saturday','Sunday')) %>%
  group_by(fare, dow, weekend) %>%
  summarize(price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

ggplot(SPrail_dow, aes(x = fare, y = price, group = dow, fill = weekend)) + 
  geom_bar(position = 'dodge', stat = 'identity') + 
  labs(fill = 'Weekend',
       x = 'Fare Type',
       y = 'Average Price',
       title = 'Flexible-Ticket Resale Prices are Lower on Weekends') + 
  theme_minimal()

```

## Choose Colors for Focus

```{r}

ggplot(SPrail_dow, aes(x = fare, y = price, group = dow, fill = weekend)) + 
  geom_bar(position = 'dodge', stat = 'identity') + 
  labs(fill = 'Weekend',
       x = 'Fare Type',
       y = 'Average Price',
       title = 'Flexible-Ticket Resale Prices are Lower on Weekends') + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('#33ccFF','red'))

```


## Also Make Them Look Good

```{r}
ggplot(SPrail_dow, aes(x = fare, y = price, group = dow, fill = weekend)) + 
  geom_bar(position = 'dodge', stat = 'identity') + 
  labs(fill = 'Weekend',
       x = 'Fare Type',
       y = 'Average Price',
       title = 'Flexible-Ticket Resale Prices are Lower on Weekends') + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('gray','#33ccFF'))
```

## Choose Intensity for Focus

```{r}
ggplot(SPrail_dow, aes(x = fare, 
                       y = price, 
                       group = dow, 
                       fill = weekend,
                       alpha = fare == 'Flexible')) + 
  geom_bar(position = 'dodge', stat = 'identity') + 
  labs(fill = 'Weekend',
       x = 'Fare Type',
       y = 'Average Price',
       title = 'Flexible-Ticket Resale Prices are Lower on Weekends') + 
  theme_tufte() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('gray','#33ccFF')) + 
  scale_alpha_manual(values = c(.4,1)) + 
  guides(alpha = FALSE)
```

## Proximity for Focus and Comparison

```{r}
SPrail_dow <- SPrail %>%
  filter(!is.na(fare)) %>%
  mutate(fare = factor(fare, levels = c('Adulto ida','Promo','Promo +','Flexible'))) %>%
  mutate(dow = factor(weekdays(start_date), levels = c('Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday','Friday','Saturday','Sunday'))) %>%
  mutate(weekend = dow %in% c('Saturday','Sunday')) %>%
  group_by(fare, dow, weekend) %>%
  summarize(price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

ggplot(SPrail_dow, aes(x = fare, 
                       y = price, 
                       group = dow, 
                       fill = weekend,
                       alpha = fare == 'Flexible')) + 
  geom_bar(position = 'dodge', stat = 'identity') + 
  labs(fill = 'Weekend',
       x = 'Fare Type',
       y = 'Average Price',
       title = 'Flexible-Ticket Resale Prices are Lower on Weekends') + 
  theme_tufte() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('gray','#33ccFF')) + 
  scale_alpha_manual(values = c(.4,1)) + 
  guides(alpha = FALSE)
```

## Declutter

- Labels might not even be necessary!

```{r}
ggplot(SPrail_dow, aes(x = fare, 
                       y = price, 
                       group = dow, 
                       fill = weekend,
                       alpha = fare == 'Flexible')) + 
  geom_bar(position = 'dodge', stat = 'identity') + 
  labs(fill = 'Weekend',
       x = 'Fare Type',
       y = 'Average Price',
       title = 'Flexible-Ticket Resale Prices are Lower on Weekends') + 
  theme_tufte() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('gray','#33ccFF')) + 
  scale_alpha_manual(values = c(.4,1)) + 
  guides(alpha = FALSE,fill = FALSE) + 
  annotate('text',x = .87, y = 36, label = 'Weekday',color = 'darkgray', alpha = 1) +
  annotate('text',x = 1.34, y = 36, label = 'Weekend',color = '#33ccFF', alpha = 1)
```

## Annotation

- Annotation can be a great way of pointing out features of the data
- But don't go wild! Reserve it
- Remember - *walk your audience through the data*, and don't be afraid to interpret for them!


## Could we Go Further?

- Declutter with days-of-week $\rightarrow$ just one point for weekday, one for weekend
- Do we need the other ticket types?
- Slope graph?
- Move the title in closer?

## Color

- Color is a very important element here
- Often the easiest tool for distinguishing things
- And very important in making the graph look good

## Things to Know about Color

- Matching color schemes and complementary colors (uh, ask someone else)
- Types of color palettes (in most software, available prepackaged!)
- Designing for the colorblind

## Color Palettes

Two main kinds of palettes:

- Sequential, for showing variation along an axis (more and less) 
- (Divergent sequential for low-middle-high)
- Distinct/qualitative, for showing different groups

## Sequential Palettes

```{r}
display.brewer.all(type='seq')
```


## Divergent Sequential Palettes

```{r}
display.brewer.all(type='div')
```

## Distinct/Qualitative Sequential Palettes

```{r}
display.brewer.all(type='qual')
```

## Color Blindness

- Most common is red/green/(orange)
- Blue/yellow also relatively common
- Some people have zero color vision

## Color Blindness

- When picking colors, avoid having your contrasts be red/green or blue/yellow. Red/blue is a popular choice here.
- For complete accessibility, focus on highly contrasting *shades*
- People who are colorblind can still generally differentiate opacity and intensity
- Colorblind-friendly palettes are available!

## Colorblind-friendly palettes

```{r}
display.brewer.all(colorblindFriendly = TRUE)
```

## Designing for Focus

- Highlight what's important
- Remove distractions
- Unimportant stuff CAN be backgrounded

## Together

- Let's work with some data and figure out our ideal design together

```{r}
library(Ecdat)
library(vtable)

data(Airline)

vt(Airline, labels = c('Airline','Year','Cost in Thousands',
                       'Output in Revenue Passenger Miles',
                       'Fuel Price',
                       'Load Factor'))
```

## Exploring

```{r}
ggplot(Airline, aes(x = cost, y = output, color = factor(airline))) + geom_point()
```

## Exploring

```{r}
ggplot(Airline, aes(x = year, y = cost, color = factor(airline))) + geom_point()
```

## Exploring

```{r}
ggplot(Airline, aes(x = year, y = pf, color = factor(airline))) + geom_point()
```
