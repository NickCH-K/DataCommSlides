- We want to tell a story with our data
- Some stories are clear
- Others are complex
- They all need to be clear

## Clutter and Focus

- A common mistake is to *show you the data* rather than *show you the story*
- The story often exists within part of the data
- We want to understand some sort of *continuity* or some sort of *distinction*
- Everything that takes away from that makes the story more opaque

## Examples

- Let's look at some data visualizations that are cluttered
- Some are still *beautiful* and lovely and works of art
- Some are impressive with the amount of information they're able to get on one graph
- But they can obscure the point they're trying to make
- With each, let's think about why

## Bible Cross-References

- The following graph shows how different chapters of the bible refer to each other
